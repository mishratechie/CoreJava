Marker interface in Java is interfaces with no field or methods or in simple word empty interface in java is called marker interface.
Example of market interface is Serializable, Clonnable and Remote interface. 
Now if marker interface doesn't have any field or method or behavior they why would Java needs it? 
This was asked to my friend in one of his core java interview and then I thought to touch based on it. 

In this article we will see couple of reason on what marker interface do in Java and what is use of marker interface in Java. 
Marker interface are also called tag interface in Java.


Looking carefully on marker interface in Java e.g. Serializable, Clonnable and Remote it looks they are used to indicate something to compiler or JVM. 

"So if JVM sees a Class is Serializable it does some special operation on it,"

similar way if JVM sees one Class is implement Clonnable it performs some operation to support cloning.
Same is true for RMI and Remote interface.
So in short Marker interface indicate, signal or a command to Compiler or JVM.
